  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  version :source do

    # This is the cropped version of parent image. Let crop to 50x50 square.
    version :thumb do
      process resize_to_fill: [120, 120]
    end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
